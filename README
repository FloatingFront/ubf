This is ubf, a framework for Getting Erlang to talk to the outside
world.  This repository is based on Joe Armstrong's original UBF code
with an MIT license file added to the distribution.



To build

1. Get and install an erlang system
   (http://www.erlang.org)

2. Optionally, get and install erlang-rfc4627
   (http://www.lshift.net/blog/2007/02/17/json-and-json-rpc-for-erlang)

3. Change to the src directory and type make
   $ cd src
   $ make

4. Run the unit test
   $ make check

5. If you have installed erlang-rfc4627, run the unit test for jsf
   $ make check-jsf


   
To do (in short term)

  - cleanup (or remove) old documentation under priv/doc
  - add ChangeLog template
  - document new features
    + ubf contract (and contract checker) primitives
    + ubf contract type imports
    + ubf server and ubf client
    + stateless server w/simplified plugin handler callbacks
    + network formats
      * ebf - Erlang Binary Format
      * jsf - Java Script Format
      * etf - Erlang Term Format
    + jsf contract and json rpc helpers
    + ???



To do (in medium term)

  - ubf contract generators for quickcheck
  - ABNF (RFC 5234) support and integration
  - erlang spec (EEP 8) integration
  - replace plugin manager and plugin handler with gen_server-based
    implementation
  - enable/disable contract checker by configuration
  - eunit tests
  - quickcheck tests
