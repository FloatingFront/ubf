<p>This is  the virtual community -the faces  behind the technology.
  Erlang. At  some time  or times in  the past  these are some  of the
  people who  have contributed  to the Erlang  system.  At  times they
  have  worked together  - then  they  split and  reformed into  other
  groups. Some of them work for ERicsson, some for Ericsson arch rival
  Nortel,  some for Alteon  WEb systems,  some for  Universities, some
  hack at home.</p>

	He thinks that OO languages really suck.
