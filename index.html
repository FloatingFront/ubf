This document and the corresponding open-source code repositories are
based on Joe Armstrong’s original UBF site and code with an MIT
license file added to the distribution.  Since then, a large number of
enhancements and improvements have been added.</p><p>UBF is a language for transporting and describing complex data
structures across a network.  It has three components:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
UBF(a) is a "language neutral" data transport format, roughly
  equivalent to well-formed XML.
</li><li class="listitem">
UBF(b) is a programming langauge for describing types in UBF(a) and
  protocols between clients and servers.  This layer is typically
  called the "protocol contract".  UBF(b) is roughly equivalent to
  Verified XML, XML-schemas, SOAP and WDSL.
</li><li class="listitem">
UBF(c) is a meta-level protocol used between a UBF client and a UBF
  server.
